                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>In my first project during our program at Chas Academy, we were introduced to Figma, a design tool that we used to create and present our initial designs. The goal of the project was to familiarize ourselves with the tool by creating a file that showcased our creativity and ability to work within a digital design environment. This file included a simple layout or concept that we later shared with the class for feedback. The project helped us understand the basics of Figma's interface, tools, and collaborative features, setting a strong foundation for more advanced design work later in the course</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>In this project, we focused on developing the visual identity for our platform by creating a detailed mood board. The mood board served as the foundation for defining the aesthetic direction of the platform, including elements such as color schemes, typography, imagery, and overall style. Our aim was to craft a cohesive and appealing design language that resonates with the target audience and aligns with the platform’s purpose of simplifying outfit selection. By exploring various inspirations and trends, we ensured that the visual identity conveys a sense of modernity, functionality, and personalization, which seamlessly integrates into the overall user experience.</p>

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on creating a digital platform designed to simplify outfit selection for users. Using AI, the platform generates personalized outfit recommendations based on users' preferences, style inspirations, and social contexts like work, parties, or casual settings. The prototype emphasizes a clear navigation system, a digital wardrobe for outfit organization, and a user-friendly interface that reduces decision fatigue and enhances the overall experience. While we have prioritized functionality and structure, future iterations will incorporate information colors and accessibility standards to further refine the platform's usability and inclusivity.</p>
